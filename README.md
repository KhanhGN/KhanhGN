### Hi there 👋 I'm Khanh
I'm a first-year Bachelor of Computer Science (Advanced) student at the University of Adelaide, with a keen interest in Data Science and Machine Learning 🌐. I'm eagerly embracing opportunities to enhance not only my technical skills but also leadership abilities. This summer, I'm keen to delve more into the professional field to learn, grow, and collaborate.
